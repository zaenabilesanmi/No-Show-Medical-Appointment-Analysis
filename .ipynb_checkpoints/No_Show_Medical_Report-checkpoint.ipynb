    "Project: Medical Appointment No-shows\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Analysis of patients attitude to medical appointments in Brazilian hospitals\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction \"No-shows\" is a term used to describe whether or not patients attend their medical appointment in Brazilian Hospitals. This project seeks to investigate factors that could affect patients showing up or not for appointment in these hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this analysis contains 110,527 appointments (rows) in total as 14 defining characteristics in specific context. While seeking to understand the impact of each variables on patients showing up for their appointment, \"No-show\" and \"Scholarship\" appears to be one of the most important of all variables. The other variables that were investigated in the dataset include:\n",
    "\n",
    "PatientId - specific to each patient\n",
    "\n",
    "AppointmentID - specific to each patient\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender - male or female\n",
    "\n",
    "Appointment Day - the day they need to visit the doctor\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule Day -the day the patient got booked for the appointment\n",
    "\n",
    "Age - how old the patient is\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbourhood - area of the appointment\n",
    "\n",
    "Scholarship -whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian free healthcare scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "Hipertension - whether or not the patient have hypertension\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes - to show whether or not the patient suffers diabetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Alcoholis - to show whether or not the patient is alcoholic\n",
    "\n",
    "Handcap - to show whether or not the person is physically challenged\n",
    "\n",
    "SMS_received - to show whether or not the patient received the reminder for the appointment\n",
    "\n",
    "No-show (Present or Absent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the effect of sending SMS and patient showing up on the day of appointment? \n",
    "- Did scholarship affect patients showing up for appointment? \n",
    "- What age range showed up more?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Wrangling And Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase involves a series of processes in order to ensure that good and cleaned data would be used for my analyis. In order to achieve this;\n",
    "\n",
    "I checked through the entire columns and to observe what type of errors needs to be corrected and brought out a descriptive histogram of the columns in order to have better visualisation..\n",
    "\n",
    "FINDINGS I observed no null values, neither were there any duplicated rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I observed outliers in the Age dataset as well as Handicap which I corrected\n",
    "\n",
    "I rename misspelt columns such as 'handcap' and hipertension to 'Handicap' and 'Hypertension'\n",
    "\n",
    "I replaced the 'No' and 'Yes' values in the 'No-show' column to 'Present' and 'Absent'for better understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "I also replaced the '1' and '0' to 'Yes' and 'No' for the SMS_received column\n",
    "\n",
    "Age range : contains category of patients' age into groups; Children: less than or equals to 2 = Babies, 3-16 = Children, 17-30 = Young Adults, 31-45 = Middle-aged Adults, 45 and above =Old Adults\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "I performed exploratory data analysis using different packages. I used bar charts as well as pie charts for better visualisation in order to show relationship between variables. My findings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients who received the SMS and showed up amounts to about 72.4% of the total patients who received SMS Patients who did not receive the SMS but showed up are about 83% of the total patients who did not receive SMS.\n",
    "Conclusion :It could be inferred that sending the SMS did not make much impact on the entire population of patients in the hospital\n",
    "Possible Area to look to: When are the patients receiving SMS?\n",
    "2.About 80% of the total patients of the hospital didnt receive scholarships with a 19% no-show rate\n",
    "\n",
    "76% of the patients who received scholarship showed up for their appointment\n",
    "Conclusion:It could be inferred that patients who didn't receive scholarship showed up more than patients who did\n",
    "Possible Area to look into: Investigate why patients who receive scholarship are not showing up more. Are more people that are not sick receiving the scholarship? More data would be needed to evalutate that\n",
    "\n",
    "Also,\n",
    "- Old Age have a total population of 24% in the total number of patients with 21% of adults showing up for their appointments\n",
    "- Adults account for 24% of the population with a show rate of 19%\n",
    "- Children show up rate accounts for 16% of the total 20% of population among patients\n",
    "- Teenagers show up rate 18% of the entire 24% Young adults population\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: It could be assumed that majority of the patients with ill healths are Old adults\n",
    "Final_Conclusion: The Scholarship scheme by the Brazilian government for healthcare is not very effective in making patients attend their medical appointments. Further survey should be carried out to obtain data in order to investigate the reasons why patients who are under the scholarship scheme miss their appiontment and also why the SMS have not been very effective\n",
    " \n",
    "Limitation: The limitation of this analysis is not having enough of data about patients such as distance from the hospital that, how long they have been using the hospital service,e.t.c can be used to analyze why some patients did not show up for their appointment.\n",
